<p>Please remember: It's important to say that using this module for content based on <b><u>news sources</b></u> is not a good idea. It works better for <b><u>blog posts</b></u>. News is about recent events, and GPT models might give wrong information, make up details, and imagine things. So, don't use this module for news-related content.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you use CNN as your RSS source, and our plugin gets the newest news from CNN, like "300 million jobs could be affected by latest wave of AI, says Goldman Sachs". Our plugin will make a blog post with that title, and the content will be made by GPT. But, the content made by GPT might not be right and could have imagined things. Because it is a very recent event. So, don't use this module for news-related content.</p>
<p>On the other hand, imagine you use an RSS from a blog talking about YouTube-related content, like "how to create a successful YouTube channel". Our plugin will make a blog post with that title, and the content will be made by GPT. In this case, the content made by GPT will be more correct and won't have imagined things.</p>
